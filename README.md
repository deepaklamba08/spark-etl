# spark-etl
<H1>Spark based ETL</H1>

<P>ETL using apache spark engine where user can specify transformations in a JSON file (Support for XML will be added soon).
All configurations provided by the user are stored in local file system (spark submit mode must be 'client' for now) and later versions will support cluster mode as well.
